BlogReaderv2
============

This is an improved BlogReader application that I have created for the programming mobile
devices courses at my university.

I have introduced some new iOS elements to this improved BlogReader such as:
- UITabViewController
  - Instead of using a simple UITableViewController, I have opted for a UITabViewController
  that directs navigation between two tabs; the posts that are created by the professor of
  the class, and the posts generated by students.
- Asynchronous Network Requests
- Caching of information on the device to optimize the user experience
- Use of BlogSpot RESTful API to retrieve professor posts.
